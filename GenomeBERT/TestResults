```We ran a test run which used a default tokenizer and 5% Uniprot trained model  which yielded Avg overlap accuraccy : 43.36352763070952%```

```Now loading the model which in training and at epoch 8th, saved at epoch 6th. Loading tokenizer which is training on all Swissprot train set.
Loading Tokenizer from models/GenomeBERTv1 and loading model from models/GenomeBERT =>Avg overlap accuraccy : 37.73116202042507%```
