Models: 

Currently running training on a model that is checkpointed on 5% of Uniprot data but using default tokenizer 

We have a trained tokenizer which was trained on 100% Swissprot (trainset).



Now we have to evaluate the above 5% Uniprot trained model trained model with a Swissprot trained tokenizer 

There is one model being trained on all diff 4 data files (Uniprot 5%s)  with a default tokenizer.

Next we will train on Swissprot alone with Swissprot trained tokenizer.

We have another 50% Uniprot Tokenizer being trained which we will train on Swissprot and that will be our ultimate tokenizer(If it finishes on time)
